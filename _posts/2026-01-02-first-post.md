# Got to start somewhere...

...and appropriately for this blog it starts on the new year. I've set this blog up as an alternative to the instagrams and facebooks of this world as a place for me to share what I want to share. I'm thinking it'll mostly be images with a couple of words, sometimes with a purpose and sometimes just as a dump. I'll also write some stuff from time to time but as you can probably tell by now, I'm not a natural writer and this blog will probably wander around aimlessly until I have something more direct. Its probably giving year 7 English homework but for now I'm going to ramble on and try and put some thoughts (however stupid) on "paper". As a first stab I'm going to talk about the past couple of days.

From as long as I've been aware, New Year's Eve/Day has always been a family event for me. Always over to Aunts and Uncles or hosting the whole rabble at our family home (not that I did much or any of the hosting). This year provided a variation on that theme however this time with a different type of family: my dearest friends.


I count myself very lucky to have an irreplaceable group of friends from my childhood. To be born in the same time and place, and through the chaos of life come out 26 years later with an unbreakable attachment to each other still intact feels pretty special. Whilst we don't see each other half as much as we really should, the times we are all together are like we've never been apart. 

Festivities (if that's even the correct word for this context) kicked off in typical style at Big Man's new DIY project, with lads trip to Morrisons where I accidentally sabotaged the 2 for £6 on fancy pizza deal followed by a good two hours of 'The Captain is Dead' played with the incorrect rules. Morning provided to be a more successful affair on that front, although we were still far from victory.

Games continued after a brief Top Gear style race to London (out dragged a nuclear blast on the M40, as pictured). Caterina and Matty have a 100% record of out-doing themselves as hosts whenever I've visited, and produced excellent homemade curry and chocolately-sticky-gooey-cake-thing. Myself and Tom produced one of the greatest comebacks of all time to clutch victory in the final round of Articulate. Nice one Tom.

I'm hoping this image is sufficiently blurry to hide our true facial features from the AI-web-scraping doom which seems to be upon us. We brought in the new year together outside, and (as adults) promptly called it a night. I'm glad my best friends also agree on my bed-time policies.

New Year's day brought excellent portions of pancakes and more time where I could just sit back and listen to everyone else bubble away. I hope to them I don't seem like I just sit in the corner and observe all the time, but they shouldn't be so entertaining if they didn't want me to do that. Love you guys <3
