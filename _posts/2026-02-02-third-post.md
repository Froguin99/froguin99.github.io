# West Lakes

In order to get best "value for money" out of a weekend, I drove over to Bassenthwaite Lake after work on Friday night. Since getting a car, I can forsee this becoming a regular journey as the number of pilgrimages to the proper hills increases. Parked up at Woodend Brow (turns out I could've just parked at Powter How and saved the extra mile) and walked up a rather steep Beckstones Gill in search of a good camp spot. The forecast was pretty windy, unusually coming from the East, so I had hoped to find some flat ground in the Beckstones Plantation but alas they don't make things flat round here. Whilst the spot I found behind the brilliantly named "Barf" was certainly sheltered, the wind certainly made itself known through the early hours of the morning.

I was slightly regretting my sleeping decisions when walking to the race HQ with a rather fast looking couple who were telling me they'd traveled from as far as Threlkeld that morning to make the race. They certainly looked more awake than I felt.

The race HQ is at Braithwaite Lodge, which isn't actually in Braithwaite but to the south at the very base of the open fell. Compared to what I'm used to in the North East, it was a large (and deep!) startline, with several GB or England runners using this as a early season wake-up. The course is a bit of a mini classic, there is a little bit of everything within a short loop. Typically the race goes Stile End - Outerside - Barrow, but this year the race was backwards (not that I've done it forwards so what does it matter to me!). The start is along the tarmac track just before Braithwaite Lodge. By the end this very short section, Tom Simpson had what must've been a 50m lead, with a big pack of us behind. Even in this behind pack, I felt like we had rocketed off, and I was just happy to be swept along in this phase of the race. There were some big names (George Foster, Kieran Wynne-Cattanach) in this company so I felt I must be doing alright.

Moving onto the fell, the gaps started to open up a little. The climb up Barrow as a couple of rolling ups and downs, which I managed to avoid by skirting to the sides and gaining a couple of seconds on. I felt strong here and started to push the pace, as I felt I could get rid of some of the group. This seemed to work, and Tom seemed to have stalled from his early start. I knew from racing him at Howtown last year that I'd be faster on the flowing running sections, so I only needed to match his pace to the top. By the summit of Barrow, we had a small gap over the rest of the pack, and I used the fun enjoyable decent to Barrow Door to catch up to the back of Tom. As we hit the wide rocky path leading up to Outerside, I tried to pass Tom for the lead, but didn't quite have the legs to make it stick so instead sat in behind. I wasn't sure that I'd wouldn't just get dropped as soon as we turned on to the steep side of Outerside so though best secure second by not going over my limit. Much to my suprise, I stuck on Tom's heels all the way up, and made a bid for glory on the techy run off to Stile End. This worked to a degree: I had a gap but only 20 meters or so.

The run down Stile End was possibly the trickest part of the race, as it is super fast and grassy, but trusting that you weren't going to go flying each time your heel hit the floor was trickly. Glancing over my shoulder I could no longer see anyone, which allowed me to ease up a little and try and save the legs for another day. However as the course arcs around to cross Barrow Gill, I saw that A. Tom was much closer than I had thought and B. you can cut this corner and not follow the path (it is a fell race afterall!). Thankfully, the remaining part of the race was pretty easy trail, and I could run relaxed (but fast enough) to get to the finish 1st. Certainly an excellent start to the season, I wouldn't have had beating Tom at any race this season on my bingo card so very happy overall. 

The rest of the afternoon involved a very slow cool down, followed by a very slow lap around Whinlatter on the Ragley (it'd have been rude not to). I did try and spend my winnings (voucher for Terrex stuff in Kong Running) but they didn't have anything my size in anyway. Then it was off to the Honister Bothy as I didn't fancy the wind in my tent again.

The following day was a recce of Black Combe, right down the in South West of the Lakes. I arrived to find it pretty much all covered in cloud, so wasn't sure how much of a recce it was actually going to be. Compared to yesterday's race, this is going to be a beast. Even the first part of the climb is supremely steep (I'll get dropped nice and early) up to Seaness. Once gained, it moves to a more runnable track up to the top. I was guessing where to cut-off from the track to take the direct line to the summit, but it worked out fine as its pretty obvious where. I got some funny looks off some underprepared hikers who clearly weren't impressed with the lack of view.

 From Black Combe to Whitecombe Head is a gentle grassy downhill which'll be useful to gain back some lost time on race day. This trend of nice downhill continues until dropping down from the currick at White Combe towards White Hall Knott. This is really steep, and only gets steeper as it drops down to the beck. There is a small trod some of the way down but I couldn't seem to find it lower down. This'll smash your legs up before the real race begins, up Black Combe the second time. This climb is a beast, it is relentless and seemed to go on much longer than the first climb. There is a bit of a trod most the way, and where theres no trod there is easy to run on grass, but still very hard on the legs.

The decent back down is also a beast. Its at the sort of angle where you're trying harder to slow yourself down than speed up. After a small section of open fell, it rejoins the main track. This is going to be painful during the race, as you can make up (or lose) a lot of time here it feels. I'll report back at a later date if my legs agree!
